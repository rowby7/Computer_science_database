# Database Design for the Computer Science Department

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a database system for a Computer Science Department. The database handles information about employees, students, courses, and departments, enabling efficient management and retrieval of data.

## Features

- **Conceptual Modeling**: ER/EER diagrams to represent the mini-world.
- **Logical Modeling**: Conversion of ER/EER models to relational schemas.
- **Normalization**: Functional dependency analysis and normalization to BCNF.
- **SQL Implementation**:
  - Table creation with primary and foreign keys.
  - Data insertion with 15+ records per table.
  - Advanced queries for retrieving and manipulating data.

## Requirements

The database tracks:
- **Employees**: Faculty and staff with detailed profiles.
- **Students**: Personal information, majors, and enrollments.
- **Courses and Sections**: Offering details and scheduling.
- **Departments**: Structural and administrative data.

## SQL Queries

The project includes:
1. Basic queries for data retrieval.
2. Advanced queries involving joins, conditions, and aggregations.
3. Queries to identify:
   - Students with top grades.
   - Cheating incidents and statuses.
   - Employees with the highest and lowest salaries.
